# sna_final_project
 
This project presents a methodology for identifying communities within the Instagram social network using the modularity class method in Gephi. Leveraging Python's extensive capabilities for data collection and preprocessing, we legally extracted Instagram data via network traffic analysis, converting it into formats compatible with Gephi. The study focuses on extracting follower and profile information, processing it into nodes and edges, and subsequently visualizing the network structure. Using modularity optimization, we identified distinct communities within the network, offering insights into the interconnectedness and clustering of Instagram users. The results highlight the efficacy of combining Python for data handling with Gephi for visualization to reveal hidden community structures in social media networks. This approach not only underscores the utility of these tools in network analysis but also provides a framework for similar studies in other social media platforms.
